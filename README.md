# Healthcare Data Warehouse Optimization Project

## Overview

### Problem Statement

Healthcare organizations often struggle with fragmented data systems, inefficient data processing, and difficulties in generating timely, accurate insights. This leads to:

- Slow decision-making processes
- Increased risk of errors in patient care and billing
- Challenges in regulatory compliance
- Inefficient resource allocation

### Solution

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehouse optimization solution using dbt (data build tool) for a healthcare dataset. Our solution addresses the above challenges by:

- Integrating multiple data sources into a centralized, optimized data warehouse
- Implementing robust data quality checks to ensure accuracy and reliability
- Utilizing dbt for efficient, version-controlled data transformations
- Providing clear documentation and data lineage for improved transparency and compliance

By streamlining the data pipeline and improving data quality, this solution enables healthcare organizations to make faster, more informed decisions, enhance patient care, and optimize operational efficiency.

## Features

- Integration of multiple healthcare data sources
- Data modeling and transformation using dbt
- Implementation of data quality checks
- Optimization of data warehouse performance
- Documentation of data lineage and transformation logic

## Dataset

This project uses a synthetic healthcare dataset that includes:

- Patient demographics
- Hospital admissions
- Medical procedures
- Billing information

The dataset is anonymized and complies with HIPAA regulations.

### Synthetic Healthcare Dataset Sources

For this project, you can use one of the following synthetic healthcare datasets:

1. [Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/): An open-source synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients.

2. [MIMIC-III Demo Dataset](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/): A publicly available critical care database with deidentified health data.

3. [HealthData.gov Health Data](https://healthdata.gov/browse): Provides various datasets related to healthcare.

4. [CDC Synthetic COVID-19 Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4): Synthetic data based on COVID-19 case surveillance.

5. [UK Biobank Synthetic Data](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/about-our-data): Offers synthetic versions of real biobank data for testing and development.

Choose a dataset that best fits your project's needs and ensure compliance with any usage terms and conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- dbt 1.0.0+
- Access to a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-data-warehouse-optimization.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your dbt profile in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`

4. Run dbt to build your models:
   ```
   dbt run
   ```

## Data Modeling

Our data modeling approach follows the following layers:

1. **Staging**: Raw data from source systems
2. **Intermediate**: Cleaned and conformed data
3. **Mart**: Business-specific data models

## Data Quality Checks

We implement various data quality checks using dbt tests, including:

- Schema tests (not null, unique, accepted values)
- Custom data quality tests (e.g., date range validations, referential integrity)
- dbt expectations for advanced testing scenarios

## Documentation

We use dbt's documentation features to generate comprehensive documentation for our data models. To view the documentation, run:

```
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```
